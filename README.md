How to calculate bounce rate? The bounce rate formula
After answering the question "What does bounce rate mean?", let's look at the bounce rate calculator and the formula it uses. Let's take Website Alpha as an example:

Name: Website Alpha;
Number of visits: 3,400; and
Number of one-page visits: 250.
The calculation of bounce rate will require three steps:

Determine the number of visits

The number of visits is the number of times someone visited the website. For our example, the number of visits is 3,400.

Determine the number of one-page visits

The number of one-page visits is the number of users who left immediately after landing on the first page they visited on the website.

The number of one-page visits for Website Alpha is 250.

Calculate the bounce rate

The last step is to calculate the bounce rate using the bounce rate formula:

bounce rate = number of one-page visits / number of visits

Hence, Website Alpha's bounce rate is 250 / 3,400 = 7.353%.
